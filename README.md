# Better Programmers Dvorak
Just a port of [ThePrimeagen's version of Programmer's Dvorak](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards).

The macOS version of the layout included on that repo is unsupported and also bad.

Main changes here include:

- Added Caps Lock layer, which restores the numbers to the numbers row.
- Holding down CMD also restores numbers for keyboard shortcuts.
    - This layer chains to other modifiers.
- Restored the option key symbols layer, including the shift/caps lock layers.

This layout might still be missing numpad stuff. There's also missing parity with the default macOS keyboard layouts over how shifting the caps lock layer works.
